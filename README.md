# hello-world
Ahoy!

My name is Arodin (Kendowin, at times). I am a novice programmer working to master web development tools such as HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I have some experience with many of these languages, as well as Python, C, C++, and GML (specific to Game Maker Studios software).

I am looking forward to learning more about Git and growing as a web dev!
